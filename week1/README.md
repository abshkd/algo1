# Notes

Since this was first week, Robert introduced the topic of _Algorithms_ using `Dyanmic Connectivity`.
There are several important take aways in the first week alone.

 - Importance of Algorithms
 - Approaching a problem with a simple brute force solution
 - Identifying the problem with the brute force solution, `time complexity`
 - How to devise a better solution by using a better data structure
 - How to identify the `time complexity` of the new solution and then improve


 During this he gave out solution to the problem of `Dynamic Connectivity` using `Quick Find` and `Quick Union` algorithms.

 In this code base I have excluded `Quick Find` as I believe he was only making a point with a simple example.

 Week 1 includes
  - Quick Union (Lazy Approach)
  - Quick Union Weighted
  - Quick Union Weighted with Path Compression
