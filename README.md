# algo1
Robert Sedgewick's Pirnceton class on Algorithms written in Python

The alogirthms classes are in Java. I wanted to practice in Python so I have written out many of the examples from his classes into Python code.
I have attempted to include all examples including ones that are notoptimized. for e.g. `Quick Union Find` even though the optimal solution is `Weighted`

## Notes
Where possible, I have retained the class names from Java so it's easier to find the code.
